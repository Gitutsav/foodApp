# foodApp
To make a restaurant app with 3 screens:
1. This screen is the landing page with 5 categories mentioned in the form of rotating cards. Each
card is a cuisine with number of dishes & range of products in a particular category (in terms of
amount). Below mentioned are 5 categories:

a. North Indian
b. Chinese
c. Mediterranean
d. South Indian
e. Italian

Below the cards, there is a segment which shows top 5 dishes being ordered at the restaurant
which is getting updated in real time i.e. the price of the dish is changing every second (assume the rate
of inc. as 1% per year).
Below the top 5 dishes section, there is a history of last orders of the users on previous visits.
This will have list of dishes order.


2. On clicking on any card, there will be range of dishes i.e. menu available for the user to choose
from (just add any 3-4 dishes). Users can add any number of dishes from the menu, which will
be added to cart


3. This screen is the checkout from the cart. On clicking a button “Order”, order number is
generated at this point.

The user will have an option to view the app in both English as well as Hindi language. You can only
focus on 1st screen for support of both languages.
